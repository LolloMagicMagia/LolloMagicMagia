## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Lorenzo**, and this is my GitHub profile where I share my personal projects and coursework.  
I hope some of my work will catch your interest! ðŸ˜Š

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deep learning and machine learning projects, with a focus on medical applications.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a curious learner, currently exploring reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems. Iâ€™m also working on a project involving transformers and their effectiveness.
- ðŸ’¬ **About me**: Iâ€™m a curious and proactive individual who enjoys tackling new challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about learning, both in tech and in life. I also love pizza, sushi, and mandolin (like a true Italian!) Iâ€™m always open to new experiences, whether it's in development or personal growth. I also like video games, anime, reading books, playing board games, and exploring the world.

Having a good daimon was not about satisfying one's desires,
but about walking faithfully the path one had chosen,
a path that leads to an inner flourishing which takes root even in hostile ground,
and eventually spreads, nurturing the soil of others along the way.
